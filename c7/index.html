<article class="content">
<p>Hailing from a time when men wore hats, the Dodgers were in Brooklyn, and a joint was still your local bar, the Manhattan held court when the cocktail was de rigueur. It also gave blue bloods a chance to slug back a bit of whiskey.</p>
<p>On the East Coast, you're likely to get rye whiskey; from Kentucky westward, expect bourbon. We take our Manhattans two parts bourbon, one part sweet vermouth, shaken over ice, and poured through a strainer. Occasionally, as with other vermouth cocktails, we'll take 'em dry or perfect, but never overly sweet. Let the vermouth take the edge off the bourbon, but never let it compromise the flavor. Wise bartenders add a dash of bitters to this libation, which would otherwise tend to be overly sweet.</p><p>The origin of the Manhattan is almost undisputed. There are two widely held versions of its creation, both tied to New York’s Manhattan Club. The earliest tale of this drink’s nativity dates back to William J. Tilden’s election as New York’s governor in 1874. Winston Churchill’s American mother hosted the victory celebration, and a forgotten bartender invented the Manhattan there, naming the drink after the club. The other story credits Supreme Court judge Charles Henry Truax with instigating the drink’s invention several years later. According to The Dictionary of American Food and Drink, Mr. Truax asked a Manhattan Club bartender to mix him up a new drink, his doctor having instructed him to lay off the Martinis to lose weight.</p>
    <h2></h2><p>Although we generally abstain from Manhattans during the summer, we're drinking them up now that it's past Labor Day. Of course, the nice thing about San Francisco is that during the course of a month you can find the right day for any drink. This fall, you'll find us at a certain zinc-capped bar, sipping this aesthetic drink from a cocktail glass, getting our ass kicked (in the most genteel fashion) by dose after dose of true Kentucky sour mash. We don't become more and more clever with each round, as we do with Sapphire Martinis, rather we become louder and slightly petulant. And then we catch ourselves, take in our environs, and decide that the one we're drinking is our last.</p>
