We'd sip this fine bourbon and mint elixir on Derby Day only if we were at least 10 miles from the track. As far as we're concerned, the Kentucky Derby is slowly slaying this classic summer cocktail with its sorry fake dispensed from drink guns and served to imbibers certain to find its sugary mint syrup distasteful, if not poisonous.
No less an authority than Hunter S. Thompson described the Derby as a scene of "decadent and depraved ... people, most of them staggering drunk." Even the Kentucky Derby Museum's curator, Candace Perry, won't defend the event, saying that with 140,000 people ordering more than 100,000 Mint Juleps and 100,000 hot dogs and other linear meats, the cheapening of the julep was bound to happen. A representative from Churchill Downs compares the predicament to that of McDonald's: "You know the first burger cooked for McDonald's was the best, and well the rest is just that - the rest."
For us, this only slightly softens the blow that the Mint Julep has been vilified as toxic by imbibers worldwide. Most, no doubt, have never tasted a properly concocted Mint Julep. As far
 as the Mint Julep being synonymous with the South, well, a poll by the University of North Carolina debunks that myth: The majority of Southerners - 74 percent, in fact - had never tasted the drink.


Fill a metal shaker with cracked ice.

Pour in the dry vermouth (we prefer Noilly Prat), stir briefly, and strain out (this may be discarded).

Add 4 ounces gin (we prefer Tanqueray, Bombay Sapphire, Beefeater) -- you want it around 94-proof.

Stir briskly for about 10 seconds, strain into chilled cocktail glass, and garnish with an olive.
