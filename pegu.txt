Pegu

George Orwell, a British colonial police officer in Burma during the '20s, observed that the past belongs to those who control the present. When it comes to the nearly forgotten Pegu cocktail, few words could ring truer.

Between the '20s and the '40s, no other exotic mix was as popular as this drink, which hails from the Pegu Club, located in a small town of nearly the same name. The bar was about 50 miles outside Rangoon, the capital of Burma - the country we refuse to call Myanmar, now better known for its infamous drug-producing region, the Golden Triangle.

According to Harry Craddock's Savoy Cocktail Club of 1930, people traveled the world round and asked everyone for this drink. But at about the time Orwell penned "Big Brother is watching you" and Burma gained its so-called independence, the Pegu vanished.

Fortunately for us, though, the Pegu is finally in resurgence, meaning that this inspiring gin cocktail has been sighted at bars that we frequent. With 1 1/2 ounces gin, 1/2 ounce Cointreau, 1/2 ounce lime juice, and a few dashes of Angostura bitters, all shaken with ice and strained into a chilled cocktail glass, the Pegu makes for a pungent drink that stimulates the senses and soothes the soul.

Although we literally can't stomach more that one or two of these acerbic cocktails, it's just as well. The Pegu's composition tends to make us saucy, so, for the sake of those around us, we never overindulge. Instead, we let this drink organize our thoughts into smart, laconic streams that seem to flow as smoothly as chants from the temples in the jungle.
