<article class="content">
    <p>On days when we’re feeling especially mortal and set adrift from the American dream, we order a Martini in hope of a spiritual revival, if only for the post-meridian. As libertine Bob Shacochis wrote, <q>I know I’m not going to live forever, and neither are you, but until my furlough here on earth is revoked, I should like to elbow aside the established pieties and raise my Martini glass in salute to the moral arts of pleasure.</q></p>
    <p>No other cocktail has come to symbolize so much. <q>Generally, the Martini signifies absolute decadence,</q> wrote James Villa in a 1973 <em>Esquire</em> article. <q>Specifically it means a bitter, medicinal-tasting beverage. It stands for everything from phony bourgeois values and social snobbery to jaded alcoholism and latent masochism.</q> But an impartial view of the Martini as a drink is absurd.<!--so suffice it to say that unlike kings, queens, and presidents, the Martini is now - more than 20 years later - above reproach. However, its marriage of gin and vermouth - first noted by writer Bernard DeVoto in 1949 - has been far from smooth. Happy enough for the first 80 or so years, the marriage foundered when vodka, our least favorite home-wrecker, entered the picture. By the early '70s, things had become so bad that even the Martini's longtime stalwart, Esquire magazine, began to bite back: "Young people do not like Martinis and they're not drinking them. Ever! Anywhere!," reported Mr. Villa in his diatribe. With the worrisome tendency by some to treat this drink as a sophisticated shooter (a plague that hit soon after Time called the Martini "an amusing antique" in 1985), we won't defend the 8 Martini, but rather will look back to a time when it was a sweeter, more civilized drink, and hope for the best.--></p><p>The origin of the Martini is as debatable as that of the cocktail.<!--, and though there are numerous tomes on the matter, we find --> Lowell Edmunds’ fine tome <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Silver-Bullet-American-Civilization-Contributions/dp/B01JXO5P3K">The Silver Bullet: The Martini in American Civilization</a><!--, from 1981 and now sadly out of print, the most reliable. (Of course, our faith in Mr. Edmunds, a classics professor at Rutgers, could stem from the fact that he and The Alchemist have sipped Martinis together.) The professor --> suggests that the <!--etymology of the term "Martini"--> name <em>Martini</em> has much to do with the confusion regarding the drink’s origin. The Martinez — arguably a Martini incognito <!--, even with its sweet vermouth and orange bitters --> — first appeared in O. H. Byron’s <a href="https://euvs-vintage-cocktail-books.cld.bz/1884-The-Modern-Bartenders-Guide-by-O-H-Byron">The Modern Bartender's Guide</a> of 1884, reports Mr. Edmunds. In 1862, Professor Jerry Thomas<!--, who clearly invented the Tom and Jerry and the Blue Blazer, --> included a "Gin Cocktail" that resembled the Martini in his <a href="https://euvs-vintage-cocktail-books.cld.bz/1929-The-Bon-Vivant-s-Companion-or-How-to-Mix-Drinks-by-Jerry-Thomas">Bon-Vivant's Companion</a>. <!--, or How to Mix Drinks. -->By the book’s 1887 edition, he had renamed the drink the Martinez and claimed credit for its creation. According to legend a traveler wandered into San Francisco’s Occidental Hotel bar before taking a ferry to Martinez and Mr. Thomas mixed him the first Martinez. <!--, though not initially under that name. Interestingly enough, however, the fine people of -->The people of Martinez, however, say the traveler was on his way to San Fran from their now-defunct Julio’s Bar. Bartender Julio Richelieu mixed the drink as change for a gold nugget used to buy a bottle of <strong>whiskey</strong>. <!--It's worth noting that our local hero and newspaper pundit Herb Caen has long considered this story poppycock. "The legends, fables, and myths [of the Martini] persist," he wrote in his 7 February 1993 column. "The preposterous tale that the birth of the Martini had something to do with the East Bay town of Martinez has been duly scotched in this space several times, but it lives on like a strong hangover."--></p>
    <!--During the late 1800s, the drink seems to have assumed the names Martinez, Martine, and today's moniker, Martini. Harry Johnson, author of the New and Improved Bartender's Manual or How to Mix Drinks for the Present Style of 1888, is credited with first publishing the drink recipe under the name Martini, but he did label the drawing of the drink "The Martine." By the turn of the century - thanks in part to the marketing of vermouth maker Martini & Rossi (then called Martini, Sola & Company), and The Oxford English Dictionary crediting the company with the drink's creation - the name Martini was entrenched, though a few more creation myths about the drink surfaced. The most accepted story - and the one that still occasionally threatens to lead to civil war between New York and San Francisco - is that Martini di Arma di Taggia, an immigrant bartender at New York's Knickerbocker Hotel in 1912, invented the drink. Although arguably a Johnny-come-lately, Martini di Arma di Taggia could have been the first to mix a Martini with dry - not sweet - vermouth, which for most Martini imbibers is what truly constitutes a Martini. Of course, well-known bartender William F. Mulhall wrote of mixing both sweet and dry Martinis at New York's Hoffman House around the same time. As for talk of the drink being named after a Swiss rifle used by the Brits and invented by Friedreich Von Martini in the late 1880s - well, anything's possible, but that one we really doubt.-->
    <p>Before the ’20s, America’s expatriates had taken the Martini overseas; in 1929 Hemingway <!--- of all people - -->made the drink famous for its refining effect <!--on imbibers, through his supposed alter ego, protagonist Frederic Henry, -->in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10799.A_Farewell_to_Arms">A Farewell to Arms.</a> Amid the throes of World War I, protagonist Frederic Henry, said <q>I had never tasted anything so cool and clean. They made me feel civilized.</q> By the ’30s, the Martini had become an icon of American culture. <!--was entrenched, and in 1934, historian Albert S. Crockett, author of The Old Waldorf Astoria Bar Book, reported that "During the first two decades of the century, the commonly accepted American definition of the cocktail was a mixture of gin and vermouth with bitters, ice.... It is noteworthy that more than half the cocktails known had vermouth as an essential. Of them all, the favorite was the dry Martini."-->But If you plan to remember anything of the Martini’s past, note that a dry Martini <!--back then -->was wet by today's standards. Before the War to End All Wars, a <!--typical--> <strong>dry</strong> Martini was 2 parts <strong>gin</strong> to 1 part <strong>vermouth</strong>. Today, the ratio has grown to a ridiculous 25 to 1. <!--, although the situation wasn't much better in the '50s. --><q>The affliction that is cutting down the productive time in the office and destroying the benign temper of most of the bartenders is the thing called the very dry Martini. It is a mass madness, a cult, a frenzy, a body of folklore, a mystique...</q><!--, an expertise of a sort which may well earn for this decade the name of the Numb (or Glazed) Fifties....," -->wrote C. B. Palmer of <em>The New York Times</em>  in 1952. <!--“Along every stretch of polished mahogany in public places and in countless living rooms there is no talk of the world crisis ... only of how to get a Martini really dry.”--></p><h2></h2>
    <p id="lastpara">When in need of a Martini as a reminder of our potential — and that the American dream carries a lot of baggage — we order an ice-cold medium Martini <!--- not "dry" nor "very dry" - with either an olive or a lemon zest--> at the best bar we can afford, knowing that the bartender will appreciate our sensibility and that the occasional <!--practice of subjecting oneself to -->snickers from the bench will only improve our character. <!--Besides, we're convinced that drinking today's dry Martinis is like living in New York: You have to work far too hard at learning to like it.--></p>
