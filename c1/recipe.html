					<h3>Method</h3>
					<ul class="tabcontent">
						<li>Fill a metal shaker with cracked ice.</li>
						<li>Pour in the dry vermouth (we prefer Noilly Prat), stir briefly, and strain out (this may be discarded).</li>
						<li>Add 4 ounces gin (we prefer Tanqueray, Bombay Sapphire, Beefeater) -- you want it around 94-proof.</li>
						<li>Stir briskly for about 10 seconds, strain into chilled cocktail glass, and garnish with an olive.</li>
						<li><!--This technique used to be known as the "in and out" martini, or == if you were one of Ed McMahon's fellow USMC fighter pilots in Korea, the "McTini." (Yes, that Ed McMahon.)-->However you make it, if you garnish your martini with a cocktail onion, it becomes a <b>Gibson</b> <!--(although this was originally made with Plymouth gin; try it, the stuff is still around)-->. If you should happen to have some excess absinthe on hand, a couple of drops will transform that Gibson into a <b>Third Degree</b><!--(the driest of the traditional martini variants, with a ratio of 7:1)-->. And if you do find that Plymouth gin, mix it 2-to-1 with French vermouth, tip in a couple dashes of orange bitters, and you've got a <b>Hoffman House</b> -- with a twist, please.<!-- (New York's Hoffman House, on Twenty-fourth Street across from Madison Square, was famous for the stupendous nakedness of its bar nude and the superlative quality of its drinks; in fact, this is our favorite martini variant, although we make ours about 5-to-1.)--> If you like to live dangerously, there exists the Italian vermouth alternative; for that, see the <b>Hearst</b>.</li>
