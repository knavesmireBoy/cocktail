                    <h3>Serving Suggestion</h3>
                    <div class="tabcontent">
                        <p>Preparing a palatable Martini requires a unique style and masterful technique. First, completely fill the mixing vessel with the freshest, coldest ice available. The container can be glass, silver or stainless steel, but it must hold 16 ounces. Pour Â½ oz of dry vermouth into the vessel in a circular motion, so as much vermouth as possible touches the ice. Next, strain the vermouth from the container. Whatever liquid stays on the surface of the ice will be enough for one or two Martinis.</p><p>Add 3 ounces of your favorite gin. With a <strong>barspoon</strong>, stir in a clockwise motion, agitating the ice against the gin. If the ice and gin are moving at the same speed, you are not succeeding. Lastly, strain the liquid into a chilled cocktail glass. Garnish with a lemon twist or a stuffed olive.</p><p>Similar drinks include the Martinez.</p></div></div>

					<h3>Method</h3>
					<ul class="tabcontent">
						<li>Fill a metal shaker with cracked ice.</li>
						<li>Pour in the dry vermouth (we prefer Noilly Prat), stir briefly, and strain out (this may be discarded).</li>
						<li>Add 4 ounces gin (we prefer Tanqueray, Bombay Sapphire, Beefeater) -- you want it around 94-proof.</li>
						<li>Stir briskly for about 10 seconds, strain into chilled cocktail glass, and garnish with an olive.</li>
						<li><!--This technique used to be known as the "in and out" martini, or == if you were one of Ed McMahon's fellow USMC fighter pilots in Korea, the "McTini." (Yes, that Ed McMahon.)-->However you make it, if you garnish your martini with a cocktail onion, it becomes a <b>Gibson</b> <!--(although this was originally made with Plymouth gin; try it, the stuff is still around)-->. If you should happen to have some excess absinthe on hand, a couple of drops will transform that Gibson into a <b>Third Degree</b><!--(the driest of the traditional martini variants, with a ratio of 7:1)-->. And if you do find that Plymouth gin, mix it 2-to-1 with French vermouth, tip in a couple dashes of orange bitters, and you've got a <b>Hoffman House</b> -- with a twist, please.<!-- (New York's Hoffman House, on Twenty-fourth Street across from Madison Square, was famous for the stupendous nakedness of its bar nude and the superlative quality of its drinks; in fact, this is our favorite martini variant, although we make ours about 5-to-1.)--> If you like to live dangerously, there exists the Italian vermouth alternative; for that, see the <b>Hearst</b>.</li>
