<p>History credits a gringo with creating the Daiquiri, but we dare to dispute 
this claim<!--. Our guess is that Cuban residents enjoyed -->, guessing that Cubans were enjoying this cocktail long before American engineer Jennings Cox set foot on the island. Mr. Cox was sent to Daiquiri, a small town on the east coast of Cuba, by the Spanish-American Iron Co. <!--to work in the iron mines -->
He worked with a group of thirsty comrades<!--. The group often--> that supposedly enjoyed the refreshing rum-and-lime beverage after a hard day’s work, and it's said that Mr. Cox named the drink after the town (some accounts, it’s worth noting, also credit a Harry E. Stout with this act). <!--Cox's chance 
acquaintance, Admiral Lucius Johnson, took the recipe and loads of rum back to 
the mainland, -->
    <a href="https://www.discoverbooks.com/B000BVZD64-A-New-Century-Beckons-A-History-of-th-p/b000bvzd64.htm">A New Century Beckons: A History of the Army and Navy Club</a> explains that <q>... Capt. Charles H. Harlow, took the ships’s junior medical officer, Lucius W. Johnson, with him on a tour of the ten-year-old battlegrounds. At Daiquiri they met Jennings Cox....who treated them to a drink he had developed to temper the fiery taste of Bacardi rum.</q> Mr Johnson soon introduced the drink to the Army and Navy Club in Washington, DC. The link thus established between the Daiquiri and American national security is still celebrated in the club’s Daiquiri Lounge.</p>
<p>Further accentuating the Daiquiri’s imperialist past is the role played by the prince of presidential style himself — JFK. The Daiquiri was one of the president’s preferred before-dinner drinks. This factoid, once revealed to the American public, brought the Daiquiri fame and popularity rivaled only by the Martini. Regrettably, the Daiquiri’s stature — and its good name — have suffered since 
the emergence of strip-mall happy hours, where this drink has been promoted as a spirituous Slurpee. <!--The true, more subtle frozen Daiquiri was invented at La Florida (later called the Floridita) in Havana, reputedly inspired by Ernest Hemingway.--></p>
<p>When making this drink, we try to follow in the footsteps of the bartender first credited with <strong>flash blending</strong> this drink: Constantino Ribailagua — “El Rey de los Coteleros” or the Cocktail King — who mixed at La Florida when it was known as “La Catedral del Daiquiri”, (“The Temple of the Daiquiri”). <!--Mr. Ribalagua's title is well deserved, as-->As David A. Embury points 
out in <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/573563161/the-fine-art-of-mixing-drinks-signed-by?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Search_UK_DSA_GGL_Main_General_New&utm_ag=UK-EN_DSA-General&utm_custom1=_k_EAIaIQobChMI2KXAlfzw7wIVwbvVCh2J_gvAEAAYASAAEgKazfD_BwE_k_&utm_content=go_11120727342_112118310227_474876607397_dsa-19959388920_c_&utm_custom2=11120727342&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI2KXAlfzw7wIVwbvVCh2J_gvAEAAYASAAEgKazfD_BwE">The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks</a>, first published in 1948: <q>His limes were gently squeezed with his fingers lest even a drop of the bitter oil from the peel get into the drink; the cocktails were mixed (but not overmixed).... The stinging cold drink was strained through a fine sieve into the glass so that not one tiny piece of ice remained in it. No smallest detail was overlooked in achieving the flawless perfection of the drink.</q></p>
<p>The Daiquiri’s classic recipe of a <strong>jigger</strong> of rum, a teaspoon of <strong>simple syrup</strong>, and ¾ ounce of lime juice is deceptively simple. Too much rum, and the taste becomes overpowering; too much lime, and it’s bitter and sharp; too much 
sugar, and you might as well toss it out.</p>
    <h2></h2>
<p>The first literary mention of the Daiquiri was in F. Scott Fitzgerald’s <a href="https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/paradise/">This Side of Paradise</a>, published in 1920. The novel is a fine reminder that this seemingly cathartic potion is best sipped (and mixed) with restraint: In a section of the book titled “The Devil,” a character orders a double Daiquiri, but a friend changes the order to four. This act is later regretted when the old man the friend sees turns out to be a “purple zebra,” — a figment of his sodden imagination.</p>
