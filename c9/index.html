<p>Only a few years back, this drink was called the "stealth Martini," first by Barnaby Conrad III, author of _The Martini_, and then by its followers. Whether the name came from the Cosmo's covert kick or from its popularity among those unimpressed by the classic Martini is of little consequence now. We're just glad the cocktail crowd hasn't deemed it passe.</p><p>Some bartenders snub the Cosmopolitaqn, comparing it to those drinks on the short list of classic cocktails. We'll admit it lacks complexity, but few can deny this drink's appeal--nor its reliability, especially in establishments staffed by slipshod mixers. In fact, whenever unsure of a bar's integrity, we start the evening with a request for Cosmopolitan, descendant of the Cold War's Cape Cod and respectable sibling of the Kamikaze shooter. Made with 1½ ounces of VODKA, ¾ ounces of COINTREAU, ½ ounce of lime juice, and a splash of cranberry juice, the only way a mizer can sabotage this cocktail is to substitute fake fruit for fresh.</p><p>No one seems to have bothered noting who mixed the first Cosmo, though many drink historians and bartenders agree that the gay community in Provincetown, Massachusetts, should be credited with the accomplishment. The moniker Cheryl Cook will occasionally surface, but it leads only to San Francisco, never to an actual person. Many bartenders - such as John Caine, owner of Cafe Mars in San Francisco and undisputed West Coast champion of this drink - partly credit the Cosmopolitan with the resurgence of the cocktail during the '70s, when FERN BARS, with their overly sweet so-called GIRL DRINKS, nearly destroyed the respectability of the bar. After all, "bounce berries" - as they're called on the East Coast - are tart treats more commonly associated with Thanksgiving than with cocktails, so adding their juice to a cocktail constituted a serious break with tradition back then.</p>
    <h2></h2>
<p>The popularity of the Cosmopolitan quickly traveled from New England to New York and then across the country. Characters like MacGyver drink it, and Hunter S. Thompson - the self-proclaimed "mad doctor of gonze journalism"--managed to get it cited in an affidavit used in The People of the State of Colorado v. Hunter Stockton Thompson. Whenever desperate for a cocktail at some endearing singles bar, we're thankful for the Cosmopolitan.</p>
