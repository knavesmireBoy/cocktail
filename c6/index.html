<article>
    <p>You know, mixology isn't organic chemistry. Wait a sec -- mixology <i>is</i> organic chemistry, which puts Victor J. Bergeron -- Trader Vic to his public -- somewhere between Lavoisier, the father of modern chemistry, and John Styth Pemberton, the cracker who came up with Coca-Cola, in the scientific pantheon. On the basis of the mai tai, Bergeron's closer to the French guy.</p><p>In 1944, as the Russians were pulverizing Hitler's Army Group Center and the Anglo-Saxons were forcing their way through the Normandy hedgerows and over the bloody coral ridges of Saipan, Bergeron surveyed the state of the world from behind the bar of his Oakland restaurant. "I felt a new drink was needed," he later wrote. Yes.</p><p>He began with a fine, 17-year-old Jamaican rum. But let's let him tell it. "I took a fresh lime, added some orange cura&ccedil;ao from Holland, a dash of rock candy syrup, and a dollop of French orgeat, for its subtle almond flavor. A generous amount of shaved ice and vigorous shaking by hand produced the marriage I was after. Half the lime shell went in for color.... I stuck in a branch of fresh mint and gave two of them to Ham and Carrie Guild, friends from Tahiti.... Carrie took one sip and said, <i>Mai tai -- roa ae!</i> In Tahitian this means 'Out of this world -- the best!'"</p>
    
    <h2></h2>
    <p>But oh how the mai tai has suffered, not the least at Bergeron's own hands. Success brought shortages and substitutions -- the fine old rum was the first to go, followed by the imported orgeat. More success brought shortcuts and mass production and inept imitation. Eventually, this divine compound was reduced to a bottled mix or a what-the-hey catchall for stray fruit juices and grades of rum a pirate would have trouble choking down. But when the experiment is performed correctly, you forget that things like world wars exist -- or are even possible. Out of this world indeed.</p>
