    <p>Two parts strong, one part sweet, and one part sour: These are the golden proportions of the classic cocktail, the Pythagorean formula of bibulous bliss. If you make the strong parts <strong>cognac</strong>, the sweet part,  <strong>Cointreau</strong> and the sour part fresh-squeezed lemon, shake it all vigorously over ice, and serve it up with a twist, be prepared to be transported back to the days before <strong>vodka</strong> arrived on the scene and ruined everything. If you can make a brilliant Sidecar, you can make any classic cocktail.</p>
 <p>The sidecar has been in full resurgence recently, meaning that versions both execrable and sublime have appeared in the bars we frequent. Out on the town, it is easy to tell if the bartender knows what his or her trade by watching one prepare this libation. A neatly sugar-coated rim, a pale opacity, a biting chill off the glass, and a tartness that makes it impossible to tell where the lemon leaves off and the Cointreau begins — these are the signs that you've got a live one. If you see your bartender reach for the sweet-and-sour mix, you're flat out of luck.</p>
     
 <p>One advantage of developing an attachment to this drink is that you have at least a ten percent chance of getting one at any non-dive bar — and the odds are improving, though the quality isn’t. “This cocktail is the most perfect example of a magnificent drink gone wrong,” explained David A. Embury in <em>The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks</em>. “It was invented by a friend of mine at a bar in Paris during World War 1 and was named after a motorcycle sidecar in which the good captain customarily was driven to and from the little bistro whre the drink was born and christened.” Mr Embury doesn’t name his friend, so we can only wonder if Harry, of Harry’s New York bar in Paris, had first mixed the drink, as is quitely rumored. But even Harry’s grandson, Duncan MacElhone, seems unsure, merely mentioning that “the history of the Sidecar is most confusing.” So we’ve decided our energy is better spent researching the Sidecar’s recipe instead of it’s past.
    <h2></h2>
    <p>Few drinks boast as many variations as the Sidecar. When feeling overwhelmed by our options, we recall a bit of common sense first presented by Mr. Embury: The Sidecar is essentially a Daiquiri made with brandy and lemon in place of <strong>RUM</strong> and lime. From there, we mix — partial, as always, to this drink’s classic proportions.</p></article>
