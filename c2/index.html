    <p>Two parts strong, one part sweet, and one part sour. These are the golden proportions of the classic cocktail, the Pythagorean formula of bibulous bliss. If you make the strong parts <strong>cognac</strong>, the sweet part,  <strong>Cointreau</strong> and the sour part fresh-squeezed lemon, and if you shake it over ice vigorously and serve it up with a twist, you will get instant transport back to the days before <strong>vodka</strong> arrived on the scene and ruined everything. If you can make a brilliant Sidecar, you can make any classic cocktail.</p>
 <p>The sidecar has been in full resurgence during the last year, meaning that both sublime and execrable versions have appeared in the bars we frequent. Out on the town, it is easy to tell if the bartender knows what he or she is doing. A neatly sugar-coated rim, a pale opacity, a biting chill off the glass, and a tartness that makes it impossible to tell where the lemon lets off and the Cointreau begins, means that you've got a live one. If you taste sweet-and-sour mix, you're fucked.</p>
 <p>One advantage of developing an attachment to this drink is that you have at least a 10 percent chance of getting one at any non-dive bar, and the chances are rising. The Sidecar fails to appear in our Gentleman's Companion of 1939, but H. L. Mencken mentions it as one of "a dozen standard varieties," suggesting it was well-established by prohibition. Some recipes call for equal parts brandy and Cointreau. As always, we are partial to the classic proportions.</p></div>
